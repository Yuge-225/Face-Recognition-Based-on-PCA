# 🖼️ Face Recognition Based on PCA

This project implements the **Eigenfaces** method for face recognition using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
It demonstrates dimensionality reduction, face reconstruction, and identification by comparing projected features.

## 🔍 About

The Eigenfaces method utilizes **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of face images, capturing the most significant features for recognition.  
This approach allows for efficient storage and comparison of facial features, making it suitable for **real-time face recognition applications**.

## ✨ Features

- 📉 Dimensionality reduction using PCA  
- 🖼️ Face reconstruction from principal components  
- 🆔 Identification by comparing projected features  
- 👁️ Visualization of eigenfaces  
- 🗃️ Support for the Yale Face Database
